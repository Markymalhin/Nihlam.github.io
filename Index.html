                    <b>About Me</b>
                    <br>
                    <p>Mariel Malhin, a 19-year-old resident of Tambulig, Zamboanga del Sur, is my name.
                        I currently attend Blancia College Foundation, INC. as a first-year student pursuing 
                         a bachelor's degree in computer science.I was the oldest of my brother's siblings. Justine Rey is the name of my brother.
                          My grandparents raised my brothers and me since we were young, but our family is broken.
                          They treat us like their own children even though we are just their grandchildren. In my spare time,
                           I like to read and play basketball.</p>

                    <b>Family</b>
                    <br>
                        <p>  Family is the cornerstone of our existence, a source of unconditional love and support that shapes our identity and values. 
                         Through the highs and lows, family stands as a resilient foundation, offering a sense of belonging and security.
                         The bonds forged within a family are enduring, creating a network of relationships that withstand the tests of time. Family is not only about blood relations
                         but also about shared experiences, traditions, and a collective history that weaves individuals into a tapestry of shared memories. It is within the embrace of family that we find solace, understanding, and a sense of continuity, fostering growth and resilience in the face of life's challenges.</p>

                    <b>Friends</b>
                    <br>
                        <p> Good friends are like anchors in the stormy seas of life, providing unwavering support and understanding.
                             They are the ones who celebrate your triumphs with genuine joy and stand by you during moments of adversity. 
                             A true friend is a confidant, someone with whom you can share your deepest thoughts and vulnerabilities without fear of judgment. 
                             The beauty of a good friendship lies in the comfort of silence, where words are not always necessary to convey understanding and empathy.
                              Ultimately, good friends are the treasures that enrich our lives, making the journey more enjoyable and meaningful.</p>
